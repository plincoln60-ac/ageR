## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of ageR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("ageR") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/special-uor) with:
``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("special-uor/ageR")
```

## Example
### Bacon model
#### Input structure
For an entiy X, the input structure should look like
```{r bacon-file-structure}
ageR::file_structure(entity = "X", am = "bacon")
```

The function `ageR::create_input` can be used to automatically create the 
appropriate file structure (as shown previously).

#### Create input structure
1. Start by creating a data frame for the sampling depths, this should have two 
numeric columns called `id` and `depth`:
```{r bacon-create-input-step1}
sample_depths <- data.frame(id = 1:100,
                            depth = seq(0, 500, length.out = 100))
knitr::kable(head(sample_depths))
```

2. Create a data frame with the core's data, this should have at least four 
columns. The first column can be of character type and the remaining must be
numeric. The column names should be `labID`, `age`, `error`, and `depth`. 
Optionally, a fifth column, `cc`, can be included to manually select the 
calibration curve for each observation.
```{r bacon-create-input-step2}
core <- data.frame(labID = paste0("X", sprintf("%03d", 1:5)),
                   age = c(50, 200, 1150, 2060, 4050),
                   error = c(10, 15, 5, 1, 70),
                   depth = c(5, 100, 230, 300, 450),
                   cc = 1)
knitr::kable(core)
```

3. Call the `ageR::create_input` function. The first parameter should be a list
containing the previous data frames, which must be called `sample` and `core`. 
Next, a working directory (`wdir`), the entity's name, and optionally the age 
model's name (by default is Bacon).
```{r bacon-create-input-step3, eval = FALSE}
ageR::create_input(data = list(sample = sample_depths, core = core), 
                   wdir = "./", 
                   entity = "X",
                   am = "bacon")
```

#### Run bacon
```{r bacon-run, eval = FALSE}
ageR::runBacon(wdir = "./", entity = "X", postbomb = 0, cc = 0)
```
